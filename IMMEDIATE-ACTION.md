## ðŸš€ Next Phase: Additional Client Deployment

### READY FOR DEPLOYMENT: Cherry, Pecan, Peach

All deployment scripts enhanced with lessons learned from Pumpkin deployment:

### Quick Deployment Commands

```bash
# Cherry Pi Deployment
./deploy-one-click-improved.sh <cherry-ip> cherry

# Pecan Pi Deployment  
./deploy-one-click-improved.sh <pecan-ip> pecan

# Peach Pi Deployment
./deploy-one-click-improved.sh <peach-ip> peach
```

### Pre-Deployment Verification

```bash
# 1. Verify Apple AP is operational
curl -s http://192.168.4.1/api/status

# 2. Check current client count
curl -s http://192.168.4.1/api/status | grep client_count

# 3. Test LED control system
curl -X POST http://192.168.4.1/api/led/pumpkin/toggle
```
